## System Architecture
The Prime Protocol follows a modular architecture designed for decentralized AI compute:

</div>

### Component Overview
- **Smart Contracts**: Ethereum-based contracts manage the protocol's economic layer
- **Discovery Service**: Enables secure peer discovery and metadata sharing 
- **Orchestrator**: Coordinates compute jobs across worker nodes
- **Validator Network**: Ensures quality through random challenges
- **Worker Nodes**: Execute AI workloads in secure containers

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Linux operating system
- CUDA-capable GPU(s) for worker operations
- Docker (version 28.1.1 or later) and Docker Compose (version v2.35.1 or later)

For complete setup instructions, refer to our [Development Setup Guide](docs/development-setup.md).

### Install Worker CLI: 
You can install the latest worker CLI using:
```
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/protocol/main/crates/worker/scripts/install.sh | bash 
```
This can also be used to upgrade the current installation to the latest release.

For the latest dev build use: 
```
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/protocol/develop/crates/worker/scripts/install.sh | bash -s -- --dev
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### Q: What is Prime Protocol?
**A:** Prime Protocol is a peer-to-peer compute and intelligence network that enables decentralized AI development at scale. It provides infrastructure for contributing compute resources to the network through workers, validators, and a coordination layer.

#### Q: Is Prime Protocol ready for production use?
**A:** No, Prime Protocol is still under active development. Currently, you can only run the protocol locally. 

#### Q: What environment variables do I need for local development?
**A:** We have provided an .env.example file with the required variables. 

#### Q: How are private keys managed securely in the system?
**A:** We're actively developing our security practices for private key management. 

#### Q: What are the recommended network isolation strategies for the worker?
**A:** We will be providing detailed documentation on how to secure workers with firewalls for ingress / egress 

#### Q: What are the funding requirements for workers?
**A:** For the current development phase, minimal testnet ETH is sufficient. Detailed information on setting up the worker will follow.
