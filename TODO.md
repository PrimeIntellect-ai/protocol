# General for MVP

- register provider cli logs can be improved
- node becomes unhealthy very quickly - heartbeat recovery counter should be increased
- starting compute pool in orchestrator main file 
- orchestrator main file - tasks arc?
- node inviter code could be nicer using local state / settings from cmd 
- node inviter should use tokio for generating invites 
- let claude check auth middleware?
- contract comment using custom contract error 
- recheck wallet file
- check todos in compute registry contract
- compute pool contract parsing ugly af
