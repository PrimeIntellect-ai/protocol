# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities very seriously and appreciate efforts to responsibly disclose findings.

Please report security vulnerabilities by emailing security@primeintellect.ai.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, please send reports privately via email. This helps ensure that any vulnerabilities are handled securely and fixed before they become public knowledge.

Please include the following information in your report:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact of the vulnerability
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations (if applicable)

## Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports within 1 business day and will keep you informed throughout the process of fixing and disclosing the vulnerability.

The general process is:

1. Security report received and acknowledged
2. Issue is investigated and severity assessed
3. Fix is developed and tested
4. Security patches are deployed
5. Public disclosure (if appropriate)

## Scope

The following are in scope for security reports:

- Prime Protocol smart contracts
- Worker node software
- Validator node software
- Discovery service
- Orchestrator service
- Protocol APIs and interfaces

## Bug Bounty Program

There is currently no formal bug bounty program, but significant vulnerabilities that are responsibly disclosed may be rewarded at our discretion.

## Security Best Practices

When running Prime Protocol nodes:

- Keep all software components up to date
- Use strong passwords and key management practices
- Follow security hardening guides for your operating system
- Monitor system logs for suspicious activity
- Maintain regular backups
- Use firewalls and access controls
- Keep private keys secure and encrypted

## Public Keys

PGP public keys for encrypted communications will be published here once available.
